Doing research early will give you the information you need to make informed decisions about: 

- which market to enter and when
- the best routes into a market
- how to position your product or service in your chosen markets

Market data should shape your plans. For example, it could show you that a country you were planning to move into has too much competition or falling demand. 

Selling to a new market without the right information could cost you time and money. In extreme cases it could put your business at risk.

### Decide what you need to know 

Plan your research to keep it focused. Common questions to start with are:

- What is the market potential?
- What are the barriers to entry?
- Who are my competitors?
- Who are my customers?
- What are the best routes to market?

### Start with desk research 

Desk research is a low cost way to focus your resources on your prioritised countries. There is a lot of general market information available online.

Choose a few countries of interest for comparison. Market size will help define the potential demand for your product. Market attractiveness is a measure of how easy it is to enter a market.
