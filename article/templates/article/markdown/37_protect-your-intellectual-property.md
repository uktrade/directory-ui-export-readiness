Intellectual property can be an idea, creative work, data, an invention or a brand. 

Intellectual property protection is what stops it from being stolen or copied by someone else.

The type of protection you&rsquo;ll need will depend on the type of intellectual property you have. 

### Why you should protect your intellectual property

Protecting your intellectual property helps to secure the future of your business. Along with theft, counterfeiting can be a danger for your business. 

Today&rsquo;s technology makes it easy for counterfeiters to make realistic copies of products, and the internet makes these counterfeits easy to sell.
