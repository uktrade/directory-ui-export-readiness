### Compare markets to pick the right one

Gather the same information for each country into a [market weighting table](http://www.export.org.uk/page/Market_Selection "market weighting table"). This should make it easy to get a comparative score for size and attractiveness making it clear where the potential demand is and which markets will be easier to enter.

### Get bespoke market information

Having selected a country based on desk research, you&rsquo;ll need specific information about the country and your product or service. Focus on:

- competitor activity in your chosen country
- customer behaviour, motivations and preferences
- the best ways to bring your product or service to market

Be prepared to spend more time and money on this stage of research. It can include desk and field research. Field research involves visiting the country so can be costly.
