# Title: Insure against non-payment
[comment]: Personas: Occasional, Regular

Before you fulfil an order, think about what happens if a buyer doesn&rsquo;t pay. You should:

- research the country to see what legal recourse you have
- consider a payment method that offers more security like a [letter of credit](/getting-paid/decide-when-youll-get-paid#Share-the-risk "letter of credit")
- consider getting insurance to cover the risk of non-payment 

See the government&rsquo;s [list of approved export insurance brokers](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-export-finance-insurance-list-of-approved-brokers/export-insurance-approved-brokers "UK Export Finance insurance: list of approved brokers"). UK Export Finance offer an insurance policy for high risk countries.
