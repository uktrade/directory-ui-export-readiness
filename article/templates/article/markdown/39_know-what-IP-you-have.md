If you&rsquo;re not sure what intellectual property (IP) you have you can find out by:

- hiring an IP lawyer
- using the [IP Equip service](http://www.ipo.gov.uk/blogs/equip/ "IP Equip service") 

[Read the Intellectual Property Office's business guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/ip-for-business-events-guidance-tools-and-case-studies#business-guidance "IPO business guidance").

### When you should apply for IP protection

[Register your business name as a trade mark](https://www.gov.uk/how-to-register-a-trade-mark "How to register a trademark - GOV.UK") first. If you don&rsquo;t register your name, you risk someone else stealing and using it. 

You should also register any brands that you market your product under. For example, Coca Cola owns Sprite which is registered as a brand that is part of the Coca Cola company.

Each country has different rules. In China, the rights belong to the first to file a successful trade mark application. In the UK, a trade mark can be challenged by a company that has already built up a reputation through sales.
