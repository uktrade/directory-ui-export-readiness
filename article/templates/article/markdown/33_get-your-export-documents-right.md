Having the right paperwork is crucial when you&rsquo;re transporting goods across borders. Missing or inaccurate documents can lead to delays and extra costs, or even prevent a deal from being completed.

You need to know which documents you or your freight forwarder will need to complete at each stage. You&rsquo;ll need specific types of documents depending on your transport method.

### Air freight documentation

An air waybill is the contract between your business and the carrier you&rsquo;re using. The e-freight project aims to remove all paperwork from air cargo transportation, making it a digital process.

Find out about the [e-freight scheme on the International Air Transport Association (IATA) website](http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/cargo/e/efreight/Pages/index.aspx "International Air Transport Association (IATA) website").

### Sea freight documentation

All consignments must have either a bill of lading or sea waybill. These documents clearly set out:

- who the consignment owner is
- the terms of the contract of carriage

A sea waybill is a receipt for the goods. A bill of lading:

- is issued by the shipping company acknowledging receipt of the goods
- allows you to still own the goods until full payment is made (it&rsquo;s a risk to release goods unless you're confident of your customer&rsquo;s creditworthiness)
- gives you security and more control over your consignments

Normally, you send the documents to your bank and they transfer the documents across to the buyer. If you&rsquo;re using an open accounts payment you send the documents to the buyer directly.
