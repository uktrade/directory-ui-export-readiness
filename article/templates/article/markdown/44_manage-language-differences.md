Knowing a few words and phrases in your client&rsquo;s language can help build rapport, even if you need an interpreter for more involved communication.

Think about how to manage language differences including:

- if you need an interpreter for overseas visits
- whether to translate tender documents
- if you need help to write tenders in a different language
- how to cope with translating for more than one language and market
- situations when speaking or writing English is acceptable
- whether to translate your website
- translating contract terms and conditions
