Meeting a client in person helps:

- build trust
- build a relationship
- set and manage expectations

Research the customs and culture in your target market. If face-to-face meetings are expected you should make them a part of your export plan. If you don&rsquo;t you could struggle to win business in that market.

### Plan your meetings

Plan overseas visits to make the most of the investment of time and money. You should:

- research the company and who you&rsquo;ll be meeting
- research the country&rsquo;s culture, language and history
- have clear objectives for your meetings
- find out if you need an interpreter
- find out if you should bring your product
- schedule several meetings to make the trip cost effective

Think strategically about how you&rsquo;ll nurture the relationship over time after your initial meeting.

### Alternatives to face-to-face meetings

Travelling to overseas meetings can be expensive and time consuming. If you can&rsquo;t afford to visit a client in their own country, you could arrange to meet them at an international trade show.

Trade shows can be cost effective if you arrange face-to-face meetings with several customers. They are a good place to market your product or service and to find agents, distributors and potential customers.

Using a local agent or distributor could help to support your relationship with an overseas customer. They can meet the customer face-to-face to manage the relationship on your behalf.

Email, phone, text, video and social media are all good ways to keep in touch with a client but are no replacement for face-to-face meetings. Facial expressions and body language are often lost, even with video conferences, making it harder to build rapport.

If the business culture of a country values face-to-face meetings to build relationships then there may be no alternative to visiting the country if you want to do business there.
