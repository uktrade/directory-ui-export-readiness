Start with your own bank. They know you and your business so are better placed to advise on the best finance options for your situation. 

If your bank can&rsquo;t help, [shop around for a bank](http://www.businessbankinginsight.co.uk "Compare business banking products and services with Business Banking Insight's impartial rating system") that can. Some banks will be more experienced in export finance than others. 

Business loans come in different shapes and sizes. As with raising any finance, you&rsquo;ll need a well considered plan that shows the growth you expect to achieve and how you&rsquo;ll pay back the debt.

The amount you’re offered will depend on:

- how secure your business is
- your business’s financial and credit history
- whether the loan is made against a security or guarantee 

If your company is less than 24 months old you could be eligible for a [Start Up Loan](https://www.gov.uk/apply-start-up-loan "Apply for a Start Up Loan").

### Use a finance platform

There are many websites that match businesses to financial products. The government requires banks to refer companies they can't help with a loan to:

* [Business Finance Compared](https://www.businessfinancecompared.com/ "Business Finance Compared")
* [Funding Options](https://exporting.fundingoptions.com/ "Funding Options")
* [Funding Xchange](https://www.fundingxchange.co.uk/?affiliate=ukef "Funding Xchange")

Other finance platforms include:

* [Alternative Business Funding](https://www.alternativebusinessfunding.co.uk/ "Alternative Business Funding")
* [Better Business Finance](http://www.betterbusinessfinance.co.uk/ "Better Business Finance")
* [Capitalise](https://capitalise.com/partners/exporting-is-great "Capitalise")
* [Find SME Finance](http://www.findsmefinance.co.uk/ "Find SME Finance")
* [Pension-led Funding](https://www.pensionledfunding.com/ "Pension-led Funding")

### Peer-to-peer lending

Businesses that want to lend are matched with businesses that want to borrow through an online platform. The loan is usually made up of small amounts from several lenders. These loans are often processed more quickly than a bank loan.

Interest rates are either fixed or lenders bid for a loan based on the interest rate they are prepared to lend at.

You have to submit accounts, go through credit checks and provide a personal guarentee from a company director to register for a loan on most platforms.

[The Peer-to-Peer Finance Association](http://p2pfa.info/p2pfa-members "Peer-to-Peer Finance Association") has a list of peer-to-peer lending sites, such as [Funding Circle](https://www.fundingcircle.com/uk/businesses/ "Funding Circle").
