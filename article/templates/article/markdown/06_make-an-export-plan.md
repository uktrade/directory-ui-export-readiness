An export plan is a business plan for selling overseas. It should detail the decisions you&rsquo;ve made based on your market research, your objectives and how you plan to achieve them.

A well structured plan will make sure you&rsquo;ve thought about all the possibilities, chosen a logical path forward and set targets to keep you on track.

Your export plan is a tool to show banks, investors or partners that you&rsquo;re serious and have realistic and achievable goals.

## What to include in your export plan

Your export plan should include:

- an explanation of why you want to export including the benefits
- your product or service offering and what makes you different from the competition
- any changes you need to make to your product or service for the new market
- your target markets and the reasons for choosing them
- how you intend to protect your intellectual property
- how you&rsquo;ll market your product
- how you intend to resource your plan including staffing and finance
- your operating model or route to market
- operational information including transport, distribution, customs and licences
- your [objectives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria "SMART objectives - Wikipedia")
