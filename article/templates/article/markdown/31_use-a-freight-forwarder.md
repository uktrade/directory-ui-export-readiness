A freight forwarder will save you time and money if you&rsquo;re exporting large volumes or high-value goods. If you&rsquo;re exporting smaller numbers you could use a parcel courier. 

A freight forwarder will:

- prepare shipping and export documents
- negotiate freight charges and arrange cargo insurance
- book cargo space - saving you money by consolidating your shipments
- advise on a country&rsquo;s rules and regulations
- take care of customs clearance or import duty
- arrange and manage several different transport methods for a shipment

You should use an experienced operator who is a member of the British International Freight Association (BIFA).

[Find a freight forwarder on the BIFA website](http://www.bifa.org/members "BIFA").

### Choose your transport

You can use any combination of road, rail, air or sea to transport your goods. Take into account:

- costs and distance
- when the goods need to arrive
- your product&rsquo;s size, weight, perishability and any need for security
- special requirements or [export licences for animals and dangerous goods](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/beginners-guide-to-export-controls "Do I need an export licence? - GOV.UK")

If you&rsquo;re working with a freight forwarder to help you manage transport and logistics, discuss the options thoroughly with them.
