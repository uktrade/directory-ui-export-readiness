Export finance can refer to specific financial products that reduce the risks that come with selling internationally. They are usually short-term products that include:

* guarantees or [letters of credit](/getting-paid/decide-when-youll-get-paid#Share-the-risk "letters of credit") to help you get paid
* working capital loans to fulfil orders
* insurance against not being paid

Many [chambers of commerce](http://www.britishchambers.org.uk/find-your-chamber/ "find your local chamber of commerce") offer services to help with letter of credit documentation. 

Your bank should be able to help you with short-term loans, guarantees and letters of credit.

For export insurance, see the government&rsquo;s [list of approved export insurance brokers](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-export-finance-insurance-list-of-approved-brokers/export-insurance-approved-brokers "UK Export Finance approved insurance brokers").

If you’re exporting to a high-risk country and your bank or insurer can’t help, you may qualify for government-backed finance through [UK Export Finance (UKEF)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-export-finance "Find out more about UKEF").
