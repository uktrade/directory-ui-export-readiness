# Use a distributor
[comment]: Personas: New to exporting, Occasional

A distributor buys your products to resell in their market. They buy at a discount and make money by selling at a higher price. 

The contract of sale is between you and the distributor. The stock they buy is their responsibility and they deal with the end customer.

A distributor will usually by in bulk and should:

- reduce your overheads and exposure to risk 
- provide access to their dealers and resellers
- be a sustainable and scalable entry into a market

### Less resource and control 

A distributor markets and sells the product and provides after sales support. Your costs will be reduced but you usually won&rsquo;t have any control over the marketing and pricing of your product.   

A good distributor may accept your suggested pricing and marketing material. 

Like agents, a distributor may want to be the only seller in a geographic region.
