If you&rsquo;re exporting to a high-risk country and your bank or insurer can&rsquo;t help, you may qualify for government-backed finance through UK Export Finance (UKEF).

UKEF is the export credit agency for the UK. It aims to make sure no viable export fails by not being able to get finance or insurance. It helps exporters by:

* guaranteeing loans and financial products
* offering finance to overseas buyer&rsquo;s of UK products
* providing insurance for high-risk countries outside of Europe and North America

[Contact UKEF](https://www.contactus.trade.gov.uk/enquiry/topic "contact UK Export Finance") for free, impartial guidance on getting finance for exporting. Select ‘Get finance’ from the enquiry options. You’ll be asked about your exporting experience, where you work and how you want to be contacted. 

Grants, loans and match funding schemes are available from government and other organisations across the country. [Search for finance and support schemes](https://www.gov.uk/business-finance-support "Finance and support for your business").

You may be able to get a grant to attend overseas trade shows through the [Tradeshow Access Programme](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tradeshow-access-programme "Tradeshow Access Programme").
