                    <ul>
                        <li>tell you why the information is needed. For example, we ask about your company’s exporting experience to decide whether it is suitable for inclusion in the Find a Buyer service.</li>

                        <li>make sure nobody has access to it who shouldn’t</li>
                        <li>tell you if the information is shared with other organisations and if you can say no to this</li>
