            You can <a class="link" href="https://www.gov.uk/world/embassies">contact the local British embassy</a> if your trade barrier
            is urgent. Their knowledge of local business practices and working hours might mean your barrier is resolved more 
            quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can still continue to send a report to us. We’re best placed to help if your barrier needs response or action 
            from a UK government department.
